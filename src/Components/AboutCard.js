                My name is Sherif I am a 23 year old web developer and social media manager from the United States.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                During the last 2 years I've set out to learn how to leverage a computer to spend less time on the boring stuff, and create more time for the things that truly matter.
                <br></br>
                So far I've worked on 4 professional projects building and maintaining websites to grow my client's businesses.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I've had the opportunity to work with many creative people throughout my time as a developer, I will list their accounts below. Maybe they can help you as much as they've helped me.
            </p>
